            <h2 id="ethernet-data-link-layer">Ethernet (Data Link Layer)</h2>

<p>Dominant wired LAN tech, first widely used as well.</p>

<p>Simpler and cheaper than token LANs and ATM. Pretty fast as well.</p>

<h3 id="csmacd">CSMA/CD</h3>

<p>Carrier sense multiple access</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wait until channel is idle to start transmission</li>
</ul>

<p>Collision detection</p>
<ul>
  <li>Listen while transmitting, if there is a colltion, then abort and send jam signal</li>
</ul>

<p>Usually ethernet do exponential back-off, if there was a collision, it waits for a random time before trying again.</p>
<ul>
  <li>After mth collision, chookse K randomly from {0, …., 2^m-1}</li>
  <li>and wait for k*512 bit times.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="limitation-on-length">Limitation on Length</h3>

<p>Suppose the latency on a network is <code class="highlighter-rouge">d</code>. And host A sends a packet to B, B will not see that packet until t+d, if a collision happens, then the earliest time A can know is t+2d.</p>

<p>This imposes some restriction on ethernet:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maximum length of the wire 2500m</li>
  <li>Minimum length of the packet 512 bits</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="frame-structure">Frame Structure</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Addresses: Source and destination MAC addresses
    <ul>
      <li>If destination address matches the adaptor, then all good, otherwise drop.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Type: Indicates higher layer protocol
    <ul>
      <li>Usually IP</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>CRC: Error checking bits</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="connectionless-service">Connectionless Service</h2>

<h3 id="connectionless">Connectionless</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No handshaking</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="unreliable">Unreliable</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Receiving adapter doesn’t send ACKs or NACKs</li>
  <li>Packets can have gaps</li>
  <li>TCP will fill the gaps, otherwise the application will see them</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="switching-data">Switching Data</h2>

<p>Different device switch different things</p>
<ul>
  <li>Physical layer: electrical signals</li>
  <li>Link layer: frames</li>
  <li>Network layer: packets</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="repeaters-physical">Repeaters (Physical)</h3>

<p>It basically monitors electrical signals on each LAN, and transmits an amplified copy. Used to increase network distance.</p>

<h3 id="hubs-physical">Hubs (Physical)</h3>

<p>Joins multiple input lines, can hold multiple line cards. Doesn’t necessarily amplify the signal, but I don’t see why not.</p>

<p>However, repeaters and hubs have problems</p>

<ul>
  <li>Huge collision domain</li>
  <li>Cannot support multiple technologies</li>
  <li>Still have limitations (still can’t go beyond 2500 meters on ethernet)
    <ul>
      <li>basically.. you are still in the same LAN!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bridges-link">Bridges (Link)</h3>

<p>Connects two or more LANs at the link layer.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Extracts destination address from the frame</li>
  <li>Looks up destination in its own table</li>
  <li>Forwards the frame</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="switches-link">Switches (Link)</h3>

<p>Basically bridges, but instead of connecting LANs it connects hosts.</p>

<h3 id="dedicated-access-and-full-duplex">Dedicated Access and Full Duplex</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Dedicated access
    <ul>
      <li>Direct connection with the switch</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Full duplex
    <ul>
      <li>Connection can go both directions</li>
      <li>So no more collision issue</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hubs-vs-switches">Hubs vs Switches</h3>

<h4 id="advantages">Advantages</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Only forwards frames to the correct host</li>
  <li>Can extend the geographic span of the network</li>
  <li>Improves privacy</li>
  <li>Applies CSMA/CD</li>
  <li>Can have different technologies</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Slower
    <ul>
      <li>Solution is cut-through switching</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Need to learn where to forward frames</li>
  <li>Higher cost</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cut-through-switching">Cut-Through Switching</h3>

<p>Buffering a frame takes time, and the delay can be quite large compared to network delays.</p>

<p>Basically two main points</p>
<ul>
  <li>Start transmitting as soon as possible</li>
  <li>Transmit the head of the packet while still receiving the tail (because head already tells you where to forward)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="self-learning">Self Learning</h3>

<p>We want to construct the switch table automatically.</p>

<p>When a packet arrives, switch inpects the MAC address and associates that MAC with the incoming interface. Now the switch knows how to reach that host.</p>

<p>If the switch doesn’t know where to send the packet, then it will just flood the network (send to every host).</p>

<h4 id="flooding-and-loops">Flooding and Loops</h4>

<p>Switches sometimes needs to broadcast frames. Which just means flooding.</p>

<p>Flooding can lead to loops if there is a cycle of switches.</p>

<h4 id="spanning-trees">Spanning Trees</h4>

<p>A spanning tree makes sure the topology has no loops, switches needs to cooperate to build the spanning tree.</p>

<p>The basic idea:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Elect a root (switch with smallest identifier)</li>
  <li>Each switch checks if its interface is on the shortest path from the root
    <ul>
      <li>Excludes it from the tree if not</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The algorithm:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Initially, each switch thinks it is the root
    <ul>
      <li>Sends out a message to every interface identifying itself as the root with distance of 0</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Upon receiving a message
    <ul>
      <li>Check root id, if smaller</li>
      <li>Start viewing that switch as root</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Adds 1 to the distance received from a neighbor
    <ul>
      <li>Checks to see which interface is not on a shortest path to root</li>
      <li>Exclude them</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>However algorithms can fail, here are some important things to note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Failure of the root node
    <ul>
      <li>Must elect a new root</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Failure of other switches
    <ul>
      <li>Must recompute</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Root switch should periodically reannouncing itself as the root</li>
  <li>Detecting failure through timeout
    <ul>
      <li>Wait to hear from others</li>
      <li>If takes too long, just claims itself to be root</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="switches-vs-routers">Switches vs Routers</h3>

<h4 id="advantages-1">Advantages</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Plug and play</li>
  <li>Fast filtering and forwarding</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="disadvantages-1">Disadvantages</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Topology is restricted to spanning tree</li>
  <li>Large networks require large ARP (address resolution protocol) tables</li>
  <li>Broadcast storms can cause the network to collapse</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://www.evernote.com/l/Aq1fMD0eDtlNAY3rRYYncgP2CCNMdVpTMXEB/image.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="the-internet-protocol-ip">The Internet Protocol (IP)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Connectionless</li>
  <li>Unreliable</li>
  <li>Best effort</li>
  <li>Uses datagram</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://www.evernote.com/l/Aq0FEwPq2T5LaLDipyBS3DqEY2w8Ub4t-PcB/image.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="fragmentation">Fragmentation</h3>

<p>A router may receive a packet larger than the maximum MTU of the outgoing link.</p>

<p>Then it must seperate the datagram into multiple smaller ones.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fragments are re-assembled by destination host, not intermediate routers.</li>
  <li>Usually we use path MTU discovery to find the smallest MTU along the path.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ip-addresses">IP Addresses</h3>

<p>IPv4 are 32 bits long, every interface has a unique IP address. IPv6 are 128 bits long.</p>

<p>IP addresses maybe assigned statically or dynamically (DHCP).</p>

<h4 id="classes">Classes</h4>

<p>Originally there were 5 classes</p>

<ul>
  <li>A: Starts with <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code>, 7 bit ID</li>
  <li>B: Starts with <code class="highlighter-rouge">10</code>, 14 bit ID</li>
  <li>C: Starts with <code class="highlighter-rouge">110</code>, 21 bit ID</li>
  <li>D: Starts with <code class="highlighter-rouge">1110</code>, 28 bit multicast group ID</li>
  <li>E: Starts with <code class="highlighter-rouge">11110</code>, 27 bit reserved</li>
</ul>

<p>But this leads to many problems</p>

<ul>
  <li>Address classes are too “regid”, A is too large, B is too small.</li>
  <li>Internally might need a seperate network ID for each link.</li>
  <li>Then the public needs to know them as well, very inefficient.</li>
  <li>Small organizations wanted class B, but there are only 16,000 class B network IDs.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two main solutions</p>

<h4 id="subnetting">Subnetting</h4>

<p>Subdivide the organization’s network ID</p>

<p>Basically you go over your net ID and use first few bits of the host ID to divide up the network.</p>

<p>Subnets are usually represented via an address plus a subet mask. <code class="highlighter-rouge">ffffff00</code> if first 24 bits are the subnet ID, last 8 bits are the host ID.</p>

<h4 id="classless-inter-domain-routing-cidr">Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)</h4>

<p>IP space is broken into line segments.</p>

<p>128.9.0.0/16 basically means the line segment containing addresses in teh range 128.9.0.0 - 128.9.255.255.</p>

<p>Longer the prefix, smaller the network, thus more specific.</p>

<p>Sometimes if an ISP serves two organizations with similar prefixes, it can sometimes aggregate them to form a shorter prefix, so other routers can have smaller tables.</p>

<p>In principle, an organization can keep its prefix if it changes service providers.</p>

<h4 id="ipv6">IPv6</h4>

<p>128 bits, it uses 8 groups of 4 hex digits.</p>

<p>Omit leading zeros and groups of zeros.</p>

<p>so <code class="highlighter-rouge">2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329</code> is basically <code class="highlighter-rouge">2001:0db8::ff00:0042:8329</code></p>

<h3 id="ipv6-transition">IPv6 Transition</h3>

<p>How do we deploy IPv6? It is fundamentally incompatible with IPv4.</p>

<p>There are many approaches</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dual stack (both v4 and v6)</li>
  <li>Translators (converts packets)</li>
  <li>Tunnels (carrys IPv6 over IPv4)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tunneling">Tunneling</h4>

<p>Basically, tunnel carries IPv6 packets across IPv4 network.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.evernote.com/l/Aq0Zh9eH4CtMSqfFsiBHJhGI5WQIXhusb-8B/image.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>However it is hard to setup tunnel endpoints and routing.</p>

<h2 id="dns">DNS</h2>

<p>Names are hierarchical and belong to a domain. Top-level domains are assigned by the Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).</p>

<h3 id="dns-query">DNS Query</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Client asks local server</li>
  <li>If local doesn’t have address, asks the root server of the requested domain</li>
  <li>Addresses are usually cached</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="icmp-internet-control-message-protocol">ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)</h3>

<p>Used by hosts and routers to communicate network-level information.</p>

<p>ICMP is carried in IP datagrams.</p>

<p>It includes type, code plus first 8 bytes of IP datagram causing error.</p>

<h3 id="traceroute">Traceroute</h3>

<p>The source sends series of UDP segments to destination</p>
<ul>
  <li>TTL = 1,2,3…</li>
</ul>

<p>When datagram in nth set arrives to nth router, the router discards datagram and sends source an ICMP message of type 11, code 0, also includes name and IP.</p>

<p>When ICMP arrives, source records RTT.</p>

<p>It will eventually arrive at destination host. Destination will return ICMP port unreachable (type 3, code 3), then source stops.</p>

            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>How do we send messages across a wire?</p>

<p>Hosts and routers are called <em>nodes</em>, and the communication path are called <em>links</em>. A frame encapsulates the datagram and sends the data through a link.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Application
Presentation
Session
Transport
Network
Data Link       &lt;- Network cards etc.
Physical        &lt;- Ethernet cables, wireless signals
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <em>data link</em> layer is responsible for transferring datagram from one node to physically adjacent node over a physical link.</p>

<p>A datagram maybe transferred to final destination using many different links, and they may have different protocols. <em>Routing algorithm</em> decides which path to take to get the datagram to final destination.</p>

<h2 id="common-link-layer-services">Common Link Layer Services</h2>

<p><em>Note: link layers may provide more services, these are just examples.</em></p>

<h3 id="framing">Framing</h3>

<p>Encapsulate datagram into frames, adding header, trailer (for example addresses and error-correction bits).</p>

<h3 id="link-access">Link Access</h3>

<p>Allows upper layers to access links, channel if shared medium.</p>

<p>MAC (Media Access Control) address is used to identify source, destination. This address uniquely identifies each device on a network.</p>

<h3 id="reliable-delivery">Reliable Delivery</h3>

<p>Usually error correction is not implemented on low error links (fiber, some twisted pairs).</p>

<p>But wireless has high error-rate, so error correction is implemented on link layer.</p>

<h2 id="common-physical-media">Common Physical Media</h2>

<h3 id="twisted-pairs">Twisted Pairs</h3>

<p>Usually max 100m.</p>

<p>CAT5 (most common), supports up to Gigabit ethernet.</p>

<p>CAT6, 6a, 7 can support 10Gbps, 40Gbps, 100Gbps.</p>

<h3 id="coaxial-cable">Coaxial Cable</h3>

<p>Usually max 200m.</p>

<p>But very slow, usually just 10Mbps (why would anyone use this???).</p>

<h3 id="fibre-optic-cables">Fibre Optic Cables</h3>

<h4 id="single-mode">Single-Mode</h4>

<p>Very narrow core. 10um, light can’t even bounce around within the core.</p>

<p>Used with lasers for long distances (100km).</p>

<h4 id="multi-mode">Multi-Mode</h4>

<p>Light can bounce within the core (50um). Used with LEDs for shorter distances, cannot go longer because modal dispersion.</p>

<h3 id="fiber">Fiber</h3>

<p>Long, thin, pure strand of glass.</p>

<p>Light propogated through internal reflection, huge bandwidth, can reach 100 petabits/kilometer/sec (Bell Labs).</p>

<h3 id="wireless">Wireless</h3>

<p>Different frequencies have different properties, and are subject to environmental effects.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Signals decrease as it propogates through matter.</li>
  <li>Other sources can interfere (for example 2.4Ghz, worst garbage ever).</li>
  <li>Multipath propogation, signal reflects off objects, so they can arrive at destination at slightly different times.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bandwidth-of-a-channel">Bandwidth of a Channel</h2>

<p>There are two main definitions of bandwidths:</p>

<ul>
  <li>B, in Hz, is the width of the pass-band in the frequency domain</li>
  <li>bps, is the information carrying capacity of the channel</li>
</ul>

<p>They are related to noise, noise limits how many signal levels can we safely distinguish.</p>

<h2 id="encoding-bits">Encoding Bits</h2>

<p>Generate analog waveform from transmitter and sample at receiver.</p>

<p>Signal transition rate = Baud rate / Versus bit rate</p>

<h3 id="nrz">NRZ</h3>

<p>Simplest encoding, Non-Return to Zero. High = 1, Low = 0.</p>

<h3 id="nrzi">NRZI</h3>

<p>Transition for 1s, no transition for 0s.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zAXrdUb.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="clock-recovery">Clock Recovery</h2>

<p>How can we distinguish consecutive 0s or 1s?</p>

<p>Sender and receivers won’t always have the same clock</p>

<p>There are a few solutions to this problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Send a seperate clock signal -&gt; Expensive</li>
  <li>Keep messages short -&gt; Limits data rate</li>
  <li>Embed clock signal in data signal</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="manchester-coding">Manchester Coding</h3>

<p>Make transition in the middle of every bit period.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Low-to-High is 0, High-to-Low is 1.</li>
  <li>Used in 10Mbps ethernet.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is self-clocking, XOR of NRZ encoding. However it has 50% efficiency.</p>

<h3 id="4b5b-codes">4B/5B Codes</h3>

<p>Maps 4 bits to 5 bits, and ensures never 3 consecutive 0s back-to-back. 80% efficiency.</p>

<p>Used in LANs (FDDI, 100Mbps ethernet).</p>

<h2 id="framing-1">Framing</h2>

<p>We need to send messages, not bits (requires synchronization). Adaptors allows hosts to exchange frames through links.</p>

<h3 id="ppp-point-to-point-protocol">PPP Point-to-Point Protocol</h3>

<p>Flag is <code class="highlighter-rouge">0x7E</code>, it indicate the start and end of of frames.</p>

<p>If payload contains this flag, it must be “stuffed” (escaped).</p>

<ul>
  <li>0x7E -&gt; 0x7D, 0x5E</li>
  <li>0x7D -&gt; 0x7D, 0x5D</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="latency">Latency</h2>

<p>How long does it take to send a message.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Propagation delay = distance / speed of light in media
    <ul>
      <li>How long does it take for 1 bit to travel.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Transmission delay = message size / rate
    <ul>
      <li>How quickly can you get the message onto the wire.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Latency = Propogation Delay + Transmission Delay</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jISgrP1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>RTT (Round-Trip-Time) is just twice the one way delay.</p>

<h2 id="throughput">Throughput</h2>

<p>Measure of system’s ability to pumpout data (not bandwidth).</p>

<p>Throughput = Transfer Size / Transfer Time.</p>

<h2 id="bandwidth-delay-product">Bandwidth Delay Product</h2>

<p>This indicates how many bits can the network “store” in any given time.</p>

<p>Suppose latency is 16 seconds, and the bandwidth is 1b/s, then the BDP is 1b/s * 16s = 16 bits.</p>

<p>Tells us how much data can be sent before a receiver sees any of it. 2x BDP means how much data we could send before hearing back about the first bit. Rule of thumb for sizing router buffers.</p>

<h2 id="packet-switching">Packet Switching</h2>

<p>End to end latency is latency of all routers added together.</p>

<p>Packet switching allows parallel transmission across all links, reducing latendy while also prevents a link from being “hogged” for a long time by one message. This is essentially the exact same idea as memory paging.</p>

<h3 id="queueing-delay">Queueing Delay</h3>

<p>Network might be busy when a packet arrives, so the actual end to end latency is</p>

<p>Transmission Delay + Propogation Delay + Queueing Delay</p>

<h2 id="error-detection-and-correction">Error Detection and Correction</h2>

<p>Link may transmit garbage, how can we detect errors when it arrives?</p>

<p>This is the responsibility of multiple layers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Transport</li>
  <li>Network</li>
  <li>Data Link</li>
</ul>

<p>Physical is not included because ofc, physical is what causes error.</p>

<p>We can add redundant data</p>

<ul>
  <li>Error detection codes: Allows errors to be recognized</li>
  <li>Error correction codes: Allows errors to be repaired</li>
</ul>

<p>Basic block codes????? page 42</p>

<h3 id="strategies-to-correct-errors">Strategies to Correct Errors</h3>

<p>There are two main strategies</p>

<ul>
  <li>Detect and retransmit, or Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)</li>
  <li>Use error correcting codes, or Forward Error Correction (FEC)</li>
</ul>

<p>Real-time media tend to use error correction because it is faster.</p>

<p>Higher levels (network+) may use retransmissions (less error, doesn’t make sense to include codes).</p>

<p>Most data networks today use error detection, not correction, because less overhead. But really depends on the application and error characteristics.</p>

<h4 id="common-correction-codes">Common Correction Codes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Hamming Codes</li>
  <li>Binary Convolutional Codes</li>
  <li>Reed-Solomon and Low-Density Parity Check Codes
    <ul>
      <li>Complex, but widely used</li>

<h3 id="the-hamming-distance">The Hamming Distance</h3>

<p>If an error turns one valid codeword into another valid one, then we cannot detect/correct them.</p>

<p>Hamming distance of a code is the smallest number of bit differences that turn any one codeword into another.</p>

<p>So for example 000/111 has HD of 3.</p>

<p>If we define our error detection code as a simple duplication, then the HD is 2 because all valid words must have at least 2 bits different.</p>

<ul>
  <li>HD d+1
    <ul>
      <li>d errors can be detected</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>HD 2d+1
    <ul>
      <li>d errors can be corrected</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="parity">Parity</h3>

<p>Start with n bits and add another so that total number of 1s is even (even parity).</p>

<p>Cannot detect even number of bit errors. Pretty bad, don’t use this garbage.</p>

<p>Random errors are detected with probability of 1/2.</p>

<h4 id="2d-parity">2D Parity</h4>

<p>Make the message a grid of bits, and add parity bits to each row and column.</p>

<p>n-D parity can usually correct n-1 errors.</p>

<p>2D parity detects all 1,2,3 bit errors, and many with &gt;3 bits.</p>

<h3 id="checksums">Checksums</h3>

<p>Widely used in IP, ICMP, TCP, UDP.</p>

<p>Checksum is the 1s complement of the 1s complement sum of the data interpreted 16 bits at a time (for 16-bit checksums).</p>

<p>Example: 4-bit checksum</p>

<p>Say we have the message 101101111010, first we divide it up to 4 bits segments</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1011
0111
1010
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and then we add them</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  1011
+ 0111
  0010  with 1 carry
  0011
+ 1010
  1101
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the 1s complement of 1101, which is 0010 is our checksum.</p>

<p>On the receiver, we just add all of them</p>

<p>1011 + 0111 + 1010 + 0010 = 1111, we are all good!</p>

<h3 id="crcs-cyclic-redundancy-check">CRCs (Cyclic Redundancy Check)</h3>

<p>Stronger then checksums, widely used in ethernet</p>

<p>Given n bits of data, generate a k bit check sequence that gives a combined n + k bits that are divisible by a chosen divisor C(x).</p>

<p>If we have 1001, interpret it as x^3 + x^0</p>

<p>Following example uses message 10011010 and generator 1101 or x^3 + x^2 + x^0</p>

<p><img src="https://www.evernote.com/l/Aq3s-J8p2TBPpL1-4c8CnMaf0NRk-otyz3gB/image.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Message to be sent is 10011010101, and it is divisible by 1101.</p>

<h3 id="reed-solomon--bch-codes">Reed-Solomon / BCH Codes</h3>

            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Threads are basically mini-processes within a process. However they share the same address space.</p>

<p>Creating threads are much faster than creating processes, in some systems, this can be 10x to 100x faster.</p>

<p>Think of threads as JS event loops, basically it.</p>

<h2 id="classic-thread-model">Classic Thread Model</h2>

<p>The classic thread model basically have all threads with their own stack and own PC.</p>

<p>Everything else is shared. The software library will take care of scheduling.</p>

<h2 id="posix-thread-standard">POSIX Thread Standard</h2>

<p>Some useful calls:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pthread_create: New thread</li>
  <li>pthread_exit: Quite the calling thread</li>
  <li>pthread_join: Wait for a thread to exit</li>
  <li>pthread_yield: Give up CPU for another thread</li>
  <li>pthread_attr_init: Create a thread attribute structure</li>
  <li>pthread_attr_destroy: Remove a thread’s attribute structure</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="user-space-thread-implementation">User Space Thread Implementation</h2>

<p>If implemented in user space, then the library have to take care of scheduling and switching. However if hardware do support store/load registers, this operation can be done very quickly, which is much faster than trapping to kernel.</p>

<p>And since everything is local, no context switch is needed, no kernel calls, it is very fast. Each process can also have its own scheduling algorithm.</p>

<h3 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h3>

<p>Thread cannot make blocking kernel calls, since that will halt all threads. Sometimes library will wrap the actual system call, but it is not really that nice to do.</p>

<p>Another issue is page fault. Which will be discussed in memory management (basically blocking the process because it needs to read instructions from disk).</p>

<p>In user space thread implementations, there is no clock interrupts. So a thread must give up the CPU before another thread can be run.</p>

            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Processes allows computers to do multiple things at once.</p>

<p>In multiprogramming system, CPU switches from process to process very quickly, make it seem that it is running them concurrently. This is usually called pseudoparallelism, in contrast to real-parallelism with multiprocessor.</p>

<p><em>In any given instant, only one process is running on one CPU.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Context Switch</em>: a context switch is the process of storing the state of a process or of a thread so that it can be restored and resumed later.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Programs cannot have assumption of timing. Say if you know 1 loop takes 0.01 millisec, you loop 1000 times to get 10 millisec. However, while in the loop, OS might already switched to another process.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="program-vs-process">Program vs Process</h2>

<p>An analogy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Recepe: Program</li>
  <li>Ingredients: Input Data</li>
  <li>Process: Reading the recepe, getting ingredients and baking the cake.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now the guy’s son runs into room and says he has been stung by a bee. The guy records where he was in the recipe, gets first aid book and following that. After first aid has been done, he goes back to cooking. This is basically how OS switches processes.</p>

<p>In real OS this is called scheduling. And if a programming is running twice, it is two processes.</p>

<h2 id="process-creation">Process Creation</h2>

<p>There are 4 principal events that cause processes to be created:</p>

<ul>
  <li>System initialization</li>
  <li>Execution of a process creation system call by a running process</li>
  <li>A user request to create a new process</li>
  <li>Initiation of a batch job</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 2 main types: foreground and background (daemons).</p>

<p>Technically, for all these cases, a new process is created by an existing process. In UNIX, only <code class="highlighter-rouge">fork</code> can be used to create new processes. After fork, the child may change its memory image using <code class="highlighter-rouge">execve</code>. Reason is so we can redirect IO before <code class="highlighter-rouge">execve</code>.</p>

<p>Parent and child have different address space. However they may share text.</p>

<h2 id="process-termination">Process Termination</h2>

<p>There are 4 ways for a process to terminate.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Normal exit</li>
  <li>Error exit</li>
  <li>Fatal error</li>
  <li>Killed by another process</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="process-hierarchies">Process Hierarchies</h2>

<p>In UNIX, a process and all of its children form a process group. When a user sends a signal from the keyboard, all members are notified.</p>

<p>In UNIX, all processes belong to a single tree, which <code class="highlighter-rouge">init</code> at the root. Processes cannot change parent (unless parent is killed by some reason).</p>

<h2 id="process-states">Process States</h2>

<p>There are 3 main states:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Running: Actually using the CPU</li>
  <li>Ready: Can run, but temp stopped for another process to run</li>
  <li>Blocked: Cannot run until some external event happens</li>
</ul>

<p>In UNIX, a process is automatically blocked if trying to read from an empty pipe.</p>

<h2 id="process-implementation">Process Implementation</h2>

<p>People use process table (PCB) to implement processes. Usually a table includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>State</li>
  <li>Memory allocation</li>
  <li>Open files</li>
  <li>Scheduling info</li>
  <li>Registers</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="interrupt-vector">Interrupt Vector</h3>

<p>Usually located at the bottom of the memory, when an interrupt happens, the hardware pushes process info onto stack, and jumps to interrupt vector. Then the interrupt procedure runs.</p>

<p>All interrupts start by saving registers, this is usually done in assembly since C cannot access these information. Then the access is handed over to interrupt handler (stack is also reset).</p>

<p>After the handler is done, the control is back to assembly to load the registers again.</p>

<p>Overview of the basic procedures are listed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hardware stacks basic program information</li>
  <li>Hardware loads PC from IV.</li>
  <li>Assembly saves registers</li>
  <li>Assembly set up new stack.</li>
  <li>Runs C interrupt service.</li>
  <li>Scheduler decides which to run next.</li>
  <li>C procedure returns to assembly code.</li>
  <li>Assembly runs new process.</li>
</ul>
