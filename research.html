        <p>My main research interest is in the field of computer science education, and how software tools can help students learn better. Following are some of the research projects I have done.</p>
        <h2>IFCAT - Immdiate Feedback Collaborative Assesment Tool</h2>
        <p>This is an on-going study, details will be released soon.</p>
        <h2>ICE MC2 - Math Classroom Collaboration</h2>
        <p>Supervising professors: Dr.Pollanen and Dr.Kang</p>
        <p>Goal of this project is to find a way to create a better online learning environment for math classrooms. There are a few focus areas of this study:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How math can be treated as a natural language instead of formal expressions.</li>
            <li>How students perform with online office hours instead of traditional in-person office hours.</li>
        </ul>
