This article is mainly notes I have taken for CSCB09/CSC209 at UofT.

## Pointers to Pointers

You can have pointers to pointers, which is very common, let's say changing original string.

```c
void chage_str(char **src); // This will be a pointer to string, which is another pointer
```

## Command Line Arguments

Command line arguemnts are passed to main using two parameters:

```c
int main (int argc, char *argv[])
```

`argc` is the number of arguments, `argv` is a list of arguments in string, 0th element is the name of the program.

You can also do

```c
int main (int argc, char **argv)
```

Reason is simple, I won't go into detail here.

## typedef

Remember when we did structs, you have to do `struct student` each time?

Use typedef to create a shorthand:

```c
struct student {
    // Def here
};
typedef struct student Student;
```

Now you can simply use `Student`.

Another shorthand would be

```c
typedef struct student {
    // Def here
} Student;
```

## Program Organization

### .h Files

`.h` files' purpose is so the compiler knows how to use each function without look into function definations.

### gcc

When you run `gcc main.c list.c -o program`

What happends are:

* First it will look for all `#include` and includes the `.h` files.
* Then compiler will compile each `.c` file, which will produce object code `.o`.
* Finally the linker will combine all object files into one program.

## Makefile

Makefiles are processed by a program called `make`.

The syntax is very simple:

```makefile
target: dependencies.c
	gcc -Wall -o main dependencies.c # Commands
```

Makefile only accepts tab, do not use spaces!!!!

```makefile
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -g
buxfer: buxfer.o lists.o lists.h
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o buxfer buxfer.o lists.o
buxfer.o: buxfer.c lists.h
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c buxfer.c
lists.o: lists.c lists.h
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c lists.c
clean:
	rm buxfer *.o
```

## Pre-processer Directives

You can use some directives to make your life easier.

```c
#define MAX 100 // Define macros
#ifndef LISTS_H // Conditionals
..
#endif
```

## Error Handling

Include `errno.h` to do error handling.

By default, `errno` is zero, but once an error occurs, it is set.

You can use `man errno` for all possible values. For example: `EACCESS`.

### perror

Use `perror` to print error message on screen.

```c
if(/* bad things happen here */) {
    perror("ERROR");
    exit(1);
}
```

## File I/O

We have already seen inputs and outputs, using printf.

But how about a file?

Coorisponding file functions are:

```c
printf -> fprintf(FILE *stream, ...)
putchar -> fputc(int c, FILE *stream)
puts -> fputs(const char *s, FILE *stream)
```

There are two main machanisms for managing files

* File descriptors, which is a small int.
* File pointers, `FILE *` that contains a file descriptor and a buffer.

### Standard Streams

All programs have three files open by default

```c
FILE *stdin; // 0
FILE *stdout; // 1
FILE *stderr; // 2
```

If you do `fprintf(stdout, ...)`, this is identical to `printf`.

### Regular Files

If you want to operate on regular files, you must open them.

```c
FILE *fopen(const char *filename, const char *mode);
```

`mode` can be `r`, `w` or `a`.

To close a file, use `fclose(FILE *stream)`.

### Reading From Files

To read from a file, use

```c
char *fgets(char *s, int size, FILE *stream);
```

It will read until `\n` or `size-1` characters.

```c
#define MAX 50
// ...
char buf[MAX];
FILE *f = fopen("file.txt", "r");
while(fgets(buf, MAX, f) != NULL) {
    printf("%s", buf);
}
fclose(f);
```

### Binary I/O

Use `fread` and `fwrite` to operate on a binary level.

```c
size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream);
size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream);
```

Both will return number of items written/read.
