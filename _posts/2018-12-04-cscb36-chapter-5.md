## Propositional Formulas

Let $PV$ be a set of propositional variables. The set of propositional formulas, denoted $F_{PV}$ is the smallest set such that:

Basis: Any propositional variable in $PV$ belongs to $F_{PV}$.

Induction Step: If $P_1$ and $P_2$ belong to $F_{PV}$ then so do the following:

* $\neg P_1$
* $P_1 \wedge P_2$
* $P_1 \vee P_2$
* $P_1 \to P_2$
* $P_1 \iff P_2$

> Note: $\neg$ is called unary connective, since it is applied to one subformula, others are called binary connectives.

### Tree Representation of $F_{PV}$

Propositional formulas can be nicely drawn using trees.

For example, the formula $\(a \vee b\) \wedge \neg c$ can be drawn as

## Truth Assignment

Let $PV$ be a set of propositional variables. A truth assignment is a function $r: PV \to \\{0, 1\\}$.

A truth assignment tells us, for each propositional variable, whether it represents a proposition that is true or false.

## Extended Truth Assignment

Extended truth assignment can be used to assign a truth value to any propositional formula, given that you have $r$.

Let $r: PV \to \\{0,1\\}$. Define a function $r^*:F_{PV} \to \\{0,1\\}$ so it is the smallest set such that:

Basis: $P \in PV$. In this case, $r^*(P) = r(P)$.

Induction step: $P \notin PV$. Then there are $Q_1, Q_2 \in F_{PV}$ such that $P$ is one of the following formula: $\neg Q_1$, $(Q_1 \wedge Q_2)$, $(Q_1 \vee Q_2)$, $(Q_1 \to Q_2)$, and $(Q_1 \iff Q_2)$.

By induction, we can assume $r^\*(Q_1)$ and $r^\*(Q_2)$ are already known.

The function for all 5 cases are ignored since they should be trivial to figure out.

If $r^*(P) = 0$ then we say $r$ falsifies $P$, otherwise it satisfies $P$.

## Some Notes on Logical Connectives

### Inclusive / Exclusive OR

When OR is inclusive, that means if $A$ and $B$ are both true, then the whole statement is still true.

When it is exclusive, it means if $A$ and $B$ are both true, then the statement is false.

In formal math, we always use inclusive or, we have a special connective for exclusive or, namely xor.

## Unique Readability Theorem

For any propositional formulas $P_1, P_2, Q_1, Q_2$ and binary connectives $+$ and $-$. If $(P_1 + P_2) = (Q_1 - Q_2)$ then $P_1 = Q_1$, $+ = -$ and $P_2 = Q_2$.

This theroem basically states, there is only one way to construct a formula. However, if we omit the parentheses this is not going to be true anymore.

Even use of parentheses is nice, but usually they are not necessary, so we use some conventions.

### Conventions to Omit Parentheses

* There is no need to write outmost parentheses, say $(a \wedge b)$ is the same as $a \wedge b$.

* $\wedge$ and $\vee$ have precedence over $\to$ and $\iff$.

* $\wedge$ has precedence over $\vee$.

* Grouping is assumed to be to the right, $a \to b \to c$ is the same as $a \to (b \to c)$

## Truth Tables

A truth table of $P$ tells us the truth value of $P$ under all possible truth assignments.

For example, $x \vee y \to \neg x \wedge z$, the truth table is going to be:

## Tautologies and Satisfiability

* $P$ is a tautology iff every truth assignment satisfies $P$.
* $P$ is satisfiable iff there is a truth assignment that satisfied $P$.
* $P$ is unsatisfiable iff it is not satisfiable. In another word, $\neg P$ is a tautology.

## Logical Implication

**Definition**: A propositional formula $P$ logically implies propositional formula $Q$ if and only if every truth assignment that satisfies $P$ also satisfies $Q$.

**Theorem**: $P$ logically implies $Q$ iff $P \to Q$ is a tautology.

## Logical Equivalence

**Definition**: $P$ is logically equivalent to $Q$ iff $P$ logically implis $Q$ and $Q$ logically implies $P$.

Properties of logical equivalence:

* Reflexivity: $P$ is logically equivalent to $P$.
* Symmetry: If $P$ is logically equivalent to $Q$ and $Q$ is logically equivalent to $P$.
* Transitivity: If $P$ is logically equivalent to $Q$, and $Q$ is logically equivalent to $R$, then $P$ is logically equivalent to $R$.

**Theorem**: $P$ is logically equivalent to $Q$ iff $P \iff Q$ is a tautology.
