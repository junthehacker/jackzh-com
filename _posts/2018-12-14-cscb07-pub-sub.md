Publish and Subscribe Pattern.

<!--more-->

Design patterns are template or a recipe to solve a problem. They are repeatable solution to common software engineering problems.

## Publish Subscribe Pattern

* One or more subscribers are interested in the state of a publisher.
    * Register their interest by attaching themselves with the publisher.
* When something changes in publisher.
    * Notify message is sent to each subscriber.
    * Each subscriber responds to the notification in way it chooses.
* When subscriber is no longer insterested in publisher state, just detatch.

Publisher is also called Observable

Subscriber is called Observer

### `Observer` Interface

* `update(Observable o, Object arg) -> void`

### `Observable` Class

* `addObserver(Observer o) -> void`
* `deleteObserver(Observer o) -> void`
* `notifyObservers() -> void`

> Note THIS IS A CLASS!

### Example

```java
class OperatingSystem extends Observable {
    public void shutDown() {
        this.setChanged();
        String event = "I am about to shut down";
        this.notifyObservers(event);
    }
}
```

```java
class File implements Observer {

    void modify(String content) {
        this.content = content;
        os.addObserver(this);
    }

    void save() {
        os.deleteObserver(this);
    }

    void update(Observable o, Object arg) {
        this.save(); // Save the file
    }
}
```

### Advantages

* Loosely coupled systems
* Encouages us to know about the relationships between different parts of our app
* One of the best tool to design decoupled systems
