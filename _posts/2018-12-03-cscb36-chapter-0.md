## Sets

If an object is $a$ in $A$, then we write $a \in A$, if not, we write $a \notin A$.

If a set has 0 elements, we call that an *empty set*, or $\emptyset$.

Number of elements within a set $A$ is called its size or cardinality, denoted by $\|A\|$.

* For infinite set $A$, $\|A\| = \infty$
* For empty set $\emptyset$, $\|\emptyset\| = 0$

### Describing Sets

There are 2 ways to describe sets.

* Extensional: List all elements within a set. For example $\\{1,2,3\\}$.
* Intensional: Describle the set with format $\\{x: \text{x is odd number}\\}$.

### Relationship Between Sets

* $A \subseteq B$: If every element in $A$ is also in $B$, then $A$ is a subset of $B$.
* $B \supseteq A$
